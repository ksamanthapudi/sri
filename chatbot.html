    <p class="note">Project by: <strong>Kavya Samanthapudi</strong></p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Chatbots are software applications designed to simulate human-like conversations using text or speech. Leveraging advanced techniques 
            such as natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML), chatbots can interpret and respond to user queries effectively. 
            This project focuses on building a chatbot powered by the <strong>Cornell Movie-Dialogs Corpus</strong>, a rich dataset of over 
            220,000 conversational exchanges extracted from movie scripts. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The goal is to create a conversational agent that mimics human interactions, using neural networks to train the chatbot to understand 
            the context and generate meaningful replies. The project was developed under the supervision of <strong>Professor Istvan Barabasi</strong>, 
            and it highlights the potential of deep learning in enhancing conversational AI systems.
        </p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Dataset Overview</h2>
        <p>
            The <strong>Cornell Movie-Dialogs Corpus</strong> provides a rich dataset suitable for training conversational models. It includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>220,579 conversational exchanges between 10,292 character pairs.</li>
            <li>Metadata such as genres, IMDB ratings, and character attributes.</li>
            <li>304,713 lines of dialogue for training purposes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This dataset is ideal for creating conversational agents due to its diversity and realistic representation of human interactions. By 
            leveraging this corpus, the chatbot learns to simulate meaningful and engaging conversations.

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Preprocessing the Dataset</h2>
        <p>
            Preprocessing is an essential step to clean and prepare the dataset for training. The following steps were performed:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Text Cleaning</strong>: Removed special characters, normalized contractions (e.g., "I'm" â†’ "I am"), and standardized text.</li>
            <li><strong>Mapping Dialogues</strong>: Created mappings between line IDs and corresponding dialogue text to reconstruct conversations.</li>
            <li><strong>Tokenization</strong>: Converted sentences into tokens (smaller units) for easier processing during model training.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            These steps ensured that the data was in a consistent format, making it suitable for training neural network-based conversational models.

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Model Training</h2>
        <p>
            The chatbot model was trained using sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) architecture, which is widely used for conversational AI. Key components include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Encoder</strong>: Processes input queries and encodes them into a fixed-length vector representation.</li>
            <li><strong>Decoder</strong>: Decodes the vector into a meaningful response using attention mechanisms.</li>
            <li><strong>Attention Mechanism</strong>: Helps the model focus on relevant parts of the input while generating responses.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The training process involved feeding the model pairs of input and output sentences from the dataset. The model learned to predict 
            responses by minimizing the error between predicted and actual outputs. This was achieved through optimization techniques such as 
            backpropagation and gradient descent.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Deployment</h2>
        <p>
            The trained chatbot was deployed on a web interface using <strong>Flask</strong>, a Python-based web framework. Users can interact 
            with the chatbot in real time through a responsive interface. The front-end design ensures a user-friendly experience, while the 
            back-end handles query processing and response generation efficiently.
        </p>
        <p>
            Deployment steps included setting up the Flask server, integrating the trained model, and designing a minimalistic yet engaging 
            user interface for interaction.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            This project demonstrates the potential of NLP and deep learning in creating conversational agents capable of simulating human-like 
            interactions. By leveraging the Cornell Movie-Dialogs Corpus, we successfully trained a chatbot to respond meaningfully to diverse 
            queries. Under the guidance of <strong>Professor Istvan Barabasi</strong>, the project highlights the synergy between theoretical 
            concepts and practical implementation in the field of artificial intelligence.
